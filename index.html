                <p>
                    <strong>Michael J. Fox</strong> is an actor, author, producer and activist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He is best known for his roles in <i>Spin City (1996 - 2000)</i>, <i>Family Ties (1982 - 1989)</i>
                    and <i>Back to the Future (1985 - 1990)</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Fox was diagnosed with <i>Parkinson's disease</i> in 1991, at age 29, which caused him to retire
                    from his career of acting. But Fox remained strong, continuing his work as a voice-over actor
                    (also gave voice to <i>Stuart Little</i>) and created the <b>Michael J. Fox Foundation</b> for
                    Parkinson's disease research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To me Michael J. Fox remains a hero forever who played <b>Marty McFly</b> and his struggle and
                    will to make a change keeps me motivated to push forward.

                <p>
                    Fox plays the role of a teenager <b>Marty McFly</b> in the movie who is accidentally sent back in time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Back to the Future was both a commercial and critical success.
                    The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and
                    eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BTTF is my personal favorite and a must watch movie for all.

                    Fox started displaying symptoms of early-onset Parkinson's disease in 1991
                    although he was not properly diagnosed until the next year.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In 1998, he decided to go public with his condition, and since then, he has been a strong advocate of Parkinson's disease research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    His foundation, <b>The Michael J. Fox Foundation</b>, was created to help
                    advance every promising research path to curing Parkinson's disease,
                    including embryonic stem cell studies.
